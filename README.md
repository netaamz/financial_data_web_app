### Overview
This project is part of the "Client-Server" course taught by Tamir at Ort Brauda College. It demonstrates a full-stack implementation combining client-side and server-side functionalities to display cryptocurrency prices by fetching real-time market data from the internet.

### Features
- Displays current cryptocurrency prices based on market value.
- Includes both client and server applications designed to manage and display cryptocurrency data.

### Technology Stack

#### Front-End:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Axios**: A library for making HTTP requests from the client-side to interact with the server-side API.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **Styled Components**: A library for writing CSS in JS, allowing for more dynamic styling in React components.
- **Vercel**: A platform used for deploying the front-end and back-end of the application, ensuring smooth and scalable deployment.

#### Back-End:
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing real-time data and handling high volume transactions.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, used for secure authentication and information exchange.
- **Nodemailer**: A Node.js module for sending emails, allowing the application to send notifications and alerts.
